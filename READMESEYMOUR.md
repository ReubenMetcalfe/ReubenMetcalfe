Hi! I’m @ReubenMetcalfe ^_^
I’m interested in most things most of the time - but in particular; Web3 Audio as a mechanism to balance the equities among stakeholder classes in Music.
I’m currently (2021) learning (building?) Multi-band, multi-phasic, procedurally-generated client-side audio steganography. (Phew!)
I’m looking to collaborate on tools to empower the next generation of artists. (But don't let that be a barrier - tell me what you're up to!)
I can be reached at hello@reubenmetcalfe.com
