Hi! I’m @ReubenMetcalfe ^_^
I’m interested in most things most of the time - but in particular; Web3 Audio as a mechanism to balance the equities among stakeholder classes in Music.
I’m currently (2021) learning (building?) Multi-band, multi-phasic, procedurally-generated client-side audio steganography. (Phew!)
I’m looking to collaborate on tools to empower the next generation of artists. (But don't let that be a barrier - tell me what you're up to!)
I can be reached at hello@reubenmetcalfe.com

Sidenote: I'm creepin around on Git looking for people smarter than I with the intent to teach them to 'yearn for the endlessness of the sea'. (Where the endlessness is relative and the sea represents expanded awareness of (and access to) vastly more powerful tooling for the creator class.)
